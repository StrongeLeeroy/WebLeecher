<p style = "font-weight: bold; font-size:110%; text-align: center;">BETA Releases</p>

<ul style = "list-style: none;">
  <li>
       v0.4.3 Beta
    <ul style = "list-style: square; padding-bottom:10px;">
      <li>   The "Generate DLC" button has been renamed to "Download DLC". The New search page (new.html.erb) now allows the user to choose
        wether he/she would like the search to generate a DLC file or not. If the user chooses to generate a DLC, the "Download DLC" button
        will show up in the results page (show.html.erb). This should reduce the wait time for those who do not need the DLC file.</li>
      <li>   The generated DLC's name was just a random combination of digits from 0 to 9, it has been changed to a more complex and secure hex
        value to avoid repetition while the /tmp/ folder hasn't gone through the daily erase.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
       v0.4.2 Beta
    <ul style = "list-style: square; padding-bottom:10px;">
      <li>   A "Generate DLC" button has been added to the Results page (show.html.erb).</li>
      <li>   It is now possible to search for 13 different download providers rather than just [MU] links.</li>
      <li>   Some significant styling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
       v0.4.1 Beta
    <ul style = "list-style: square; padding-bottom:10px;">
      <li>   Initial Search submit form (new.html.erb) has been redesigned for a easier and more intuitive design.</li>
      <li>   A link to the origin thread has been added to the Results page (show.html.erb) for convenience (ex: To check if there is a password to the file).</li>
      <li>   About page has been updated and styled.</li>
      <li>   Minor styling (font styling for the most part).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
       v0.4.0 Beta
    <ul style = "list-style: square; padding-bottom:10px;">
      <li>   Bad URI code was being cause by the 35 second limit between searches. To avoid this, the
             thread links have been added to the values in the update.html.erb so that two forum searches
             are not performed per actual search, improving performance at the same time.</li>
      <li>   The first thread in the update.html.erb view is now selected by default to avoid server side
             errors.</li>
      <li>   Minor styling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
